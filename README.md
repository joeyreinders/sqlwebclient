# sqlwebclient
very old project, webclient for database operations.

This project was started in the summer of 2014, I never finshed it and never cleaned up the code.
My idea was to have a multi database-vendor client, much like what already exists today, but as a web client.
I store this project on github, in order not to lose the source code.
